This is a simple Treasure hunt challenge which i've designed

step by step walkthrough of the project

1.goto index.html and open on your local server, this page asseses curiosity of user as nothing is present in this page he'll be forced to go for inspecting the page
where he would find the url to next page

2.In the secong page you're provided a link of  picture that you would download ,boom and once its empty and corrupted saying non displayable,now user willl use his problem solving skill to somehow get info out of the image -tjis will be done by openingimage in a txt editor,which will give you the clue to the next  page

3.Now on the third page you're given an audio,and by listening to that user may get an idea that it may be a morsecode here listening and critical thinking are assesed,decoding the audio would give the address to the next page

4.Now user is redirected to a terminal where he'll be in confusion is it fully a linux environment or its copy,there are some commands which would get him to a deadlock,
the user uses his problem solving skill to get password and username and then login for further infoo

5.now the stego page ,here user's visual skills are tested how he looks at a problem and gets clues out of it

6.at penultimate step he;s given some clue to reach the final pagee

7.at final page user would extract the password and then collect the treausre

#one who completes the whole challenge would have excellent soft skills
